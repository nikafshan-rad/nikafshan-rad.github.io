# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a second year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Abdul Sattar]([https://experts.griffith.edu.au/18511-abdul-sattar/])'s [IIIS Group]([https://www.griffith.edu.au/institute-integrated-intelligent-systems]) at [ICT@GriffithUni]([https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-information-communication-technology]). I received my B.E. from Mathematic Department, Khayyam Univ., Iran, and M.S. from Computer Science Department, Tabari university. 

My research focuses on developing principled *AI-driven* approaches, with *little human curation and labeling*, to diagnostic and prognosis of ALS where I have high-dimension data and I want to transform it into structured heterogeneous information networks, on which mutation drivers can be further uncovered flexibly and effectively based on polygenic score.
