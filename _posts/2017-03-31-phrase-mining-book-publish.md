Together with Zakaria and Prof. Jalali, we have written a great paper "[Prediction of rock mass rating system based on continuous functions using Chaosâ€“ANFIS model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136516091400269X)". After years of effort, we were able to publish in the best journal of mining engineering, and we rocked the mining community.
